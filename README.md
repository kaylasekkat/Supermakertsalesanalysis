# Supermakertsalesanalysis
This notebook is an exploratory analysis on the Kaggle dataset, "Supermarket Sales" using Python in Jupyter Notebook. This Dataset explores 3 months of sales in a Myanmar supermarket in 2019. The analysis utilizes the following Python libraries:

Numpy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Analysis Questions
The analysis intends to answer the following questions:
1)	What is the average amount spent in a single transaction?
2)	Does membership increase customer spending potential?
3)	What is the best-selling product line?
4)	What day of the week has the highest and lowest sales?
5)	Do men or women spend more money in the store?
6)	What is the most popular type of Payment?

Key Takeaways:


1)	The average amount a customer spends at the supermarket is 322.97. Since the data was collected in Myanmar this      is most likely Kyats instead of dollars. Unfortunately the data does not specify.
2)	The member to non-member ratio is very close in comparison. 50.1% of all transactions were done by customers         with membership. The customers with membership did show to have a slightly higher average spending. Members          transactions total average was 327.79 whereas the non-members transaction averaged 318.12. So the data doesn’t       show a large difference on whether membership will influence spending potential.
3)	The data shows that the best-selling product line is the Food and Beverages with 56144.84 in total sales. The        product line with the lowest performing sales is the Health and Beauty line with 49193.74 in total sales.  
4)	The data shows the day of the week with the highest sales is Saturday with 5612.81 in sales. The day with the        lowest sales is Mondays with only 37899.10 in sales.
5)	The data does show that there is a difference in spending based on gender. The average spending for the males is     310.79ks and for Females is 335.10ks. So on average women do spend more on their total transactions then men do. 
6)	The data shows there isn’t a very large difference between the different payment types. The least used payment       type is the credit card 31.1% and the E-wallet and cash type are equal at 34.5%.
